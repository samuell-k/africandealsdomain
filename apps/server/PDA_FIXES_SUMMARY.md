# PDA (Pickup Delivery Agent) Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Order Status ENUM Values**
**Problem**: The database was using new ENUM values (`PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, etc.) but the API endpoints were still using old string values (`processing`, `confirmed`, `shipped`).

**Fixed in**:
- Available orders query: Changed from `('processing', 'confirmed')` to `('PENDING', 'PROCESSING')`
- Order acceptance query: Changed from `('processing', 'confirmed')` to `('PENDING', 'PROCESSING')`
- Active orders query: Changed from `('shipped', 'processing')` to `('ASSIGNED_TO_PDA', 'PDA_EN_ROUTE_TO_SELLER', 'PDA_AT_SELLER', 'PICKED_FROM_SELLER', 'EN_ROUTE_TO_PSM')`
- Order status update: Changed from `'shipped'` to `'ASSIGNED_TO_PDA'`

### 2. **Agent Authentication Middleware**
**Problem**: The `verifyPickupDeliveryAgent` middleware was only checking for `agent_type = "pickup_delivery"` but the database had `"pickup_delivery_agent"`.

**Fixed**: Updated the query to check for both values:
```sql
SELECT * FROM agents WHERE user_id = ? AND (agent_type = "pickup_delivery" OR agent_type = "pickup_delivery_agent")
```

### 3. **Foreign Key Constraint Issues**
**Problem**: The API was using user IDs instead of agent record IDs for the `agent_id` foreign key in the orders table.

**Fixed in**:
- Order acceptance endpoint: Now gets the agent record ID from the `agents` table
- Active orders query: Now uses agent record ID instead of user ID
- Status update endpoint: Now uses agent record ID for verification
- Agent assignments: Now uses correct agent record ID

### 4. **Multiple Duplicate Endpoints**
**Problem**: There were multiple endpoints for the same functionality with different implementations.

**Fixed**: Updated the correct endpoints that were being called by the frontend.

## Test Results

✅ **Login**: PDA can successfully log in
✅ **Available Orders**: PDA can see available orders (10 orders found)
✅ **Order Acceptance**: PDA can accept orders successfully
✅ **Active Orders**: Accepted orders appear in active orders list
✅ **Status Updates**: PDA can update order status (e.g., to `PDA_EN_ROUTE_TO_SELLER`)
✅ **Order Details**: PDA can view detailed order information

## Endpoints Working

1. `POST /api/auth/agent-login` - Agent login
2. `GET /api/pickup-delivery-agent/available-orders` - Get available orders
3. `POST /api/pickup-delivery-agent/accept-pickup/:orderId` - Accept an order
4. `GET /api/pickup-delivery-agent/active-orders` - Get active orders
5. `PUT /api/pickup-delivery-agent/orders/:id/status` - Update order status
6. `GET /api/pickup-delivery-agent/order-details/:id` - Get order details

## Database Changes Required

The fixes work with the existing database structure but require:
1. Proper ENUM values in the `status` column of the `orders` table
2. Correct agent records in the `agents` table with proper `agent_type` values
3. Foreign key relationships between `orders.agent_id` and `agents.id`

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
node test-complete-pda-flow.js
```

This test covers the complete PDA workflow from login to order status updates.
